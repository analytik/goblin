# Installing on your own bare metal server (Hetzner, Scaleway, OVH ...)

This guide is for people who are willing to spend $50 a month or so for dedicated hardware.

Pros:
* you can run anything else on it (minecraft server, etc)
* it's powerful enough for possibly hundreds of active users (possibly also hundreds of thousands of registered, inactive users, but that's a speculation until I do benchmarks)
* no dependency on shady, unpredictable cloud billing - the monthly cost will never go up with higher usage
* possibly fun if you're a developer and want to host other projects

Cons:
* not the cheapest
* definitely not for people who can't afford the time to troubleshoot a bit
*
